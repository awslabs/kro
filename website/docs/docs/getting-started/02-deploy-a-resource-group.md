# Deploy a Resource Group

ResourceGroups are the core building blocks of KRO. They define the structure of
your application and the resources it requires. In this guide, you'll learn how
to deploy a ResourceGroup using KRO.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Installed KRO on your Kubernetes cluster
- A ResourceGroup manifest file

For this examole, we'll use a simple ResourceGroup that defines a Deployment and
a Service. Here's an example of a `ResourceGroup` manifest file:

```yaml title="deploymentservice-rg.yaml"
apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceGroup
metadata:
  name: deployment-service
spec:
  apiVersion: v1alpha1
  kind: DeploymentService
  definition:
    spec:
      name: string
  resources:
    - name: deployment
      definition:
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: ${schema.spec.name}
        spec:
          replicas: 1
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: deployment
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: deployment
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: ${schema.spec.name}-deployment
                  image: nginx
                  ports:
                    - containerPort: 80
    - name: service
      definition:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: ${schema.spec.name}
        spec:
          selector:
            app: deployment
          ports:
            - protocol: TCP
              port: 80
              targetPort: 80
```

## Steps

1. **Create a ResourceGroup manifest file**: Create a new file with the
   ResourceGroup definition. You can use the example above as a template.

2. **Deploy the ResourceGroup**: Use the `kubectl` command to deploy the
   ResourceGroup to your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deploymentservice-rg.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify the resources**: Check the status of the resources created by the
   ResourceGroup using the `kubectl` command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get rg
   ```

   You should see something like this:

   ```bash
   NAME                                   APIVERSION   KIND                STATE    AGE
   deployment-service                     v1alpha1     DeploymentService   ACTIVE   16m
   ```

4. **Install a resource group instance**: Create a instance for the resource group you
   just deployed. Instances are used to define the desired state of the resources
   in the ResourceGroup.

   Here's an example of a Instance for the `EKSCluster` ResourceGroup:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1
   kind: DeploymentService
   metadata:
     name: my-deployment-and-service
   spec:
     name: app1
   ```

   The spec fields of a Instance correspond to the parameters defined in the
   ResourceGroup.
